Storm is a free and open source distributed real-time computation system. 
Storm makes it easy to reliably process real-time streams of data, 
doing for real-time processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. 
Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, 
and is a lot of fun to use!

Storm has many use cases: real-time analytics, 
online machine learning, continuous computation, 
distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: 
a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. 
It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, 
and is easy to set up and operate.
